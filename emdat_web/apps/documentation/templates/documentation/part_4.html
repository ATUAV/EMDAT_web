    <div class="sub-par">
        <p>
            As explained in Chapter 2, in order to use EMDAT on your data, you will need to export ‘All-Data.tsv’, ‘Fixation-Data.tsv’
            and ‘Event-Data.tsv’ files for each participant in your experiment. Please refer to your Tobii studio manual for details of how this can be done.

    <h2 id="sub-par-4-2">4.2 Generating ‘.seg’ and ‘.aoi’ files</h2>

    <div class="sub-par">
        <p>
            The other two types of information that may be needed by EMDAT are the definition of AOIs (‘.aoi’ file) and the definition of Scene and Segments (‘.seg’ files).
            If you are using AOIs that are active throughout the experiment for one user, then you can easily define and export AOIs using AOI tool in Tobii studio.
            However, if your AOIs are active only in certain time intervals for each user, you may need to create customized ‘.aoi’ files for each user according to the
            extended ‘.aoi’ format as explained in section 2.2.
            When it comes to defining Scene and Segments, depending on the experiment design you can have a very basic one line ‘.seg’ file for each user such as:
        </p>

        <code>MainScene&lt;tab&gt;Seg1&lt;tab&gt;0&lt;tab&gt;120000&lt;newline&gt;</code> <br> <br>

        <p>
            This line defines one Scene with only one Segment that covers the whole experiment for the user (120 seconds in the above example). You can also have more complex
            set of Scenes with multiple Segments or even Scenes with overlapping time intervals. All these different designs are supported by the ‘.seg’ file format described in Section 2.2.

    <h2 id="sub-par-4-3">4.3 Changing the BasicParticipant class</h2>

    <div class="sub-par">
        <p>
        The EMDAT distribution includes an example implementation of the Participant class, called BasicParticipant. This class implements a typical scenario where all
            the input files are provided and the experiment only includes general AOIs. You can directly use this code for your project if you have a similar use case.
            The only change that may be necessary is in the read_participants method where the full names of the files are generated.
            If you have a more complicated scenario you will need to implement a more complicated Partition method that generates the Scene list based on the ‘Events-Data.tsv’
            files and/or some external log files generated by the software that was under study. It is important to note that you may need to add a mechanism to
            generate ‘.aoi’ files for your dynamic AOIs as well.

    <div class="sub-par">
        <p>
            EMDAT uses a large number of parameters that enables the researchers to customize different aspects of the process of calculation of features without any
            need for any changes in the code. In this section we will look at the list of the parameters EMDAT uses and their meaning.
